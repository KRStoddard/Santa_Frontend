## Description

Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, many people have less money this year to buy everyone a gift. A good solution is to do a Secret Santa exchange - that way, everyone in the event gives one gift and gets one gift. It's a fun, fair, and easy way to ensure everyone has an exciting and low-stress holiday.

Secret Santa is usually run by having everyone draw names out of a hat. However, if people are choosing not to get together due to the pandemic, someone would have to voluntarily give up their ability to participate in order to match everyone up. And that's not fair! So that's where this website comes in. It will assign people for you. It uses a React.js frontend framework. See the backend [here](https://github.com/KRStoddard/Santa_Back).
